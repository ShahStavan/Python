### Let's Start a Journey from Basics to Advance in Python [Zero0Ô∏è‚É£ to Heroü¶∏]
Let's cover Basics and then intermediate and then let's play with Datasets with numpy library and after heading towards plotting charts with matplotlib library in Pythonüêç

### Roadmap
- Cover Basics
- Numbers
- Variables
- Lists
- Tuples and Dictionary
- Strings and it's functions
- Conditional Statements
- Iterative Loops
- Practice Questions
- Reading Files [.txt and .cv files]
- Moving towars numpy and pandas
- Open CV
- Further we will head towards AI and ML modules

### Working with Face Detection using OpenCV
You need to download <strong>Haar Cacade Face Recognition and Eye Recognition .xml files </strong> either from my <a href="https://github.com/ShahStavan/Python">Python Repo</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/ShahStavan/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades">opencv</a>. <br>
Code : <a href="https://github.com/ShahStavan/Python/blob/main/facedetection.py">Face Detection</a> <br>
For Further Help : <a href="https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/face-detection-with-haar-cascade-in-opencv-python/"> Face Detection with HAAR Cascade in OpenCV Python </a>

### Working with Stock Market Data in Python
For that you need to install few libraries in Python such as Pandas and Numpy. Basically we will fetch data from different resources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Aplhavantage and Quandl using pandas_datareader.<br>
